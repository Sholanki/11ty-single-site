So, while creating this website, I went for the usual light and dark mode - white background with black colored fonts for light mode and black background and white font color for dark mode. One of my friends suggested to check out [coolors](https://coolors.co/). It is a nice website where one can explore palettes, shades and choose themes based on color in mind. 
I chose [light theme](https://coolors.co/006d77-83c5be-edf6f9-ffddd2-e29578) for the light mode and this [dark theme](https://coolors.co/464daf-8187dc-8e94f2-9fa0ff-ada7ff-bbadff-cbb2fe-dab6fc-ddbdfc-e0c3fc) for dark mode. I changed the luminance in dark mode to 20% for the first shade '464daf'

Awesome site and it is one of the tools that I will definitely use.
