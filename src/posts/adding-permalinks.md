So, to show the post [Upcoming tweaks](https://sad-shannon-2c6f9c.netlify.app/upcoming-tweaks/) as part of navigation bar item and to change the url, I was tinkering around with permalinks. This is what I stumbled upon:
1. Add the word `permalink` as part of frontmatter
2. Define the permalink value.
3. Permalink values can also be saved for collection of items as form of json.

Well, that was short, nifty and very much effective. It worked out pretty well. Till then, enjoy and have fun.
