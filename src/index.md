## Introduction of this website

#### Hi! This is ShoBiz and I am creating a third website with help of 11ty and I am sharing my thoughts, my journey in coding done so far. For the first few months, I have been inactive and have just been ruminating with job, time to waste and doing nothing basically.

#### I found this sweet spot and this website [11ty.rocks](https://11ty.rocks/) and thereby began my interest in making websites and most importantly having fun with it. 

### So, let me give you an overlay of this website. 
1. In `posts` section, you will find all the posts which document on how to install plugins or add new features in eleventy. It includes the post, the site references that I have used and the errors that I have stumbled upon and how it has been resolved or is the issue still there.
2. Here's a hack. In the post ['Tools I found useful'](https://shobiz-eleventy-site.netlify.app/tools-i-found-useful/), all the links that I have used are mentioned in no specific order.
3. The section `About Me` is basic introduction myself of what I am doing currently.
